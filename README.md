# **Sportify (Android App)**

## **Description**

This project involved the development of an Android application within Android Studio, aiming to deliver tailored sports recommendations to users by analysing their preferences alongside local weather conditions. The app integrates seamlessly with an external weather API to provide real-time weather information, enabling the generation of a curated list of sports suitable for the current conditions. Leveraging the Google Maps API, the app also identifies and presents the nearest locations where users can actively participate in their chosen sports. This comprehensive approach aims to enhance the user experience by combining personalized sports recommendations with localized and weather-appropriate options.

## **Pages**
1. Profile Page: Users have the capability to personalize their experience by adding their name and selecting their favorite sports from an extensive list provided.
2. My Recommendations Page: This section presents a curated list of sports activities tailored to the user's preferences and the prevailing weather conditions. Each listed sport is interactive, enabling users to access a map feature that pinpoints their location and identifies nearby venues suitable for engaging in the selected sport.
3. Map Page: This page visually represents the user's geographical location through an integrated map, offering a comprehensive view and accurate pinpointing.
4. Weather Page: Providing an in-depth analysis of current weather conditions, this page allows users to input a city name, extending the functionality to explore weather details in other regions.

## **Troubleshooting**
To address any issues encountered with the application, please adhere to the following troubleshooting procedures:
1. Ensure that your internet connection is active.
2. Verify that you have granted the necessary location permissions for the application.
3. If challenges persist, consider resetting the cache of the application.
4. In the event that the issue persists despite the previous steps, attempt to resolve it by re-installing the application.

## **Imporatant**
For security reasons, the API key has been excluded from the code. To test the project, please put your personal Google Maps API key in the 'AndroidManifest.xml' file (line 26) and the 'NearBySearch.java' file (line 21).
